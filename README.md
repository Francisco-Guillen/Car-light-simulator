# Simulating Car Lighting Using a Velleman K8055 Board

## Description
Using the K8055 Velleman board, various lamps were used, such as:
- Lighting (minimum, medium and maximum);
- Signalling (indicators, brakes, reverse gear);
- Auxiliary (interior, licence plate light);
  
Controlled by various means, such as
- Switches actuated by the driver (low and high beam lever);
- Brake pedal;
- Sensores autom√°ticos de luminosidade.

## K8055 Velleman Board
- The K8055 board has 5 digital input channels and 8 digital output channels. In addition, there are two analogue inputs and two analogue outputs with 8-bit resolution;
- It is possible to increase the number of inputs and outputs by connecting more boards (up to a maximum of four) to the USB connectors on the machine in use;
- All the communication routines are grouped together in a DLL (Dynamic Link Library);

## Board Architecture
In order to represent the car's automatic sensors and using digital inputs to represent certain scenarios, they were specified as follows: 
- Digital input 1: Brightness sensor -> switches on the high beams and number plate in the event of low light;
- Digital input 2: Fog sensor -> switches on the fog lights automatically in an environment with reduced visibility;
- Digital input 3: Open door sensor -> switches on the car's interior light if a door is found to be open;

To represent the output of a car's lighting control, the output channels were specified as follows:

## Interface
In order to represent the various levers corresponding to each light, as well as the choice of different lighting scenarios, the following interface was created:
